## Technologies

This application is written in Python 3.7 using JupyterLab version 3.0.14.

Python libraries used:

 - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) - *an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.*
 - [Pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pathlib.html) - *a library that enables consistent input and output of files from the main app.*
  - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/user_guide.html) - *an open source machine learning library that supports supervised and unsupervised learning.*
 - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) - *an end-to-end open source platform for machine learning.*
 - [Keras](https://keras.io/about/) - *a deep learning API written in Python, running on top of the machine learning platform TensorFlow.*

### Installation Guide

prior to running these libraries, install them from the command line:
  - pandas: `conda install pandas` or `pip install pandas`  
  - pathlib: `pip install pathlib`
  - sklearn: `pip install-U scikit-learn` - included in conda
  - TensorFlow: `pip install tensorflow` or `pip install --upgrade tensorflow`
  - Keras: included in TensorFlow
